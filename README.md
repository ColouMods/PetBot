# PetBot
This bot origially started as a little bit of a joke, but it actually has quite a few interesting features. And I mean interesting this time.

Some of these features include:
- Polls
- Haikus
- Mimicking users
- Sending messages on command
- Probably other stuff

Of all my bots, this probably has the most actual worth in a discord server. Is it a lot of worth? Probably not.
